# Language Recognition and Translation Project

## Overview

This project is designed to recognize the language being spoken and translate it into another language of choice. The system uses speech recognition to identify the spoken language, converts the spoken words into text, and then translates the recognized text into a target language. This project provides a seamless way to communicate across different languages using speech.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition:** Detects the spoken language in real-time.
- **Language Identification:** Automatically identifies the language being spoken.
- **Translation:** Translates the recognized text into a language chosen by the user.
- **Multiple Language Support:** Works with a wide variety of languages for both recognition and translation.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Provides near real-time feedback for language translation.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core language for implementing the logic.
- **SpeechRecognition:** For converting speech to text.
- **Langdetect:** For identifying the language of the spoken text.
- **Googletrans (Google Translate API):** For translating the recognized text into the target language.
- **Text-to-Speech (Optional):** Converts translated text back into speech for audio output.

## Example
![Project Screenshot](images/Screenshot%202024-08-27%20001500.png)

- **You speak:** "how are you?"
- The program recognizes this as English.
- It translates the text to Hindi: "आप कैसे हैं"
